Desktop - A desktop is either a computer interface showing icons and files or a personal computer designed for use at a single location, consisting of a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and system unit.
CPU - The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the primary component of a computer that performs most of the processing tasks. It executes instructions from programs, manages data, and coordinates other hardware components. Often referred to as the "brain" of the computer, the CPU influences the system's overall performance.
GPU - A GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is a specialized processor designed to accelerate rendering images, animations, and video for display. It handles complex calculations required for graphics rendering, making it essential for gaming, video editing, and other graphics-intensive tasks. Unlike a CPU, which focuses on general processing tasks, a GPU is optimized for parallel processing, allowing it to perform many operations simultaneously.
DPU - A DPU (Data Processing Unit) is a specialized processor designed to handle data-centric tasks, such as data storage, networking, and security. It offloads these functions from the CPU, improving performance and efficiency in data-intensive applications.
